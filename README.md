Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending company that connects borrowers with investors through an online platform. It serves people who need personal loans ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 40,000. Borrowers receive the full amount of the loan granted, minus the initial fee that is paid to the company. Investors buy promissory notes backed by personal loans and pay the Lending Club a service fee. The Lending Club company provides data on all loans granted through its platform during certain periods.
For the purposes of this project, data on loans granted through the Lending Club in the years 2007-2011 were used. Each loan has an indication of whether it has finally been repaid (Fully Paid or Charged off in the loan_status column). 

Task is to build a classification model that, based on this data, will predict with a certain accuracy whether the potential borrower will repay his debt on the loan taken. The data set is accompanied by a file with a description of all variables.

Individual stages of the analysis:
1. Data Processing
2. EDA
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling
