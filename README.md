Lending Club is a peer-to-peer loan company, that connects borrowers with investors using an online platform. It serves people who need personal loans ranging from $ 1,000 to $ 40,000. Borrowers receive the full amount of the loan, minus the initial fee that is paid to the company. Investors buy promissory notes that are backed by personal loans and pay the Lending Club a fee for the service. The Lending Club company provides data on all loans granted using its platform during certain periods. For the purpose of this project, data were used from the 2007-2011 years. Each loan has an indication (Fully Paid or Charged off in the loan_status column). This task is to build a classification model, that based on this data, will predict with a certain accuracy if the potential borrower will repay his debt on the loan taken. The file with a description of all the variables is attached to the data set.

Individual stages of the analysis:
